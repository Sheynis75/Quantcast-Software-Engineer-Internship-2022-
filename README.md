Most_Active_Cookie coding task provided by Quantcast

The code utilizes python libraries and built in functions to go through a file containing cookies along with their dates and determine which cookie/cookies are acitve for any given day. The code itself references methods which are in pythons documentation, but the code's logic and methods are all my own. Feel free to message me about any questions you may have about the code and how it works or if there are any improvements I can make to make the code run more efficiently.
